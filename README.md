# What?
This is an implementation for Baroness. The rules are described on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroness_(solitaire)

# How
This is how I decided to handle the moves:
1. Deal Card Move: Click on the deck
2. Discard King Move: Drag the King and release it on the discard pile
3. Discard Two Cards Move: Drag one card on top of the other. These 2 cards will
then be placed on top of the discard pile.
4. Fill Gap Move: Drag the card you want and release it on the empty pile
